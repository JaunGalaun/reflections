When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when there is a master project and you only are working on one part
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
when you are ony working on specific branches of a master project and you dont need the rest of the files in the github repository
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
branches separate from the master branch to do changes without altering the master path. Clones copy all files and commits from a repository, forks getes all files from somebody else's project and creates a copy in github
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
in order to check if you are ahead, behind or out of sync with remote.
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
I would use a dropbox folder for the team and add different versions.  It would be easier to see the versions of all team members but harder to track and merge.
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
when you want them to be reviewed and be seen by the administrator as other branches per team member. You would like to use master when is part of the genera construct of the project.
